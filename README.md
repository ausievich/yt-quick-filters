Add quick filter buttons to YouTrack Agile Boards — just like Jira has had for years.

👉 [Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/iaddgmcajdiblafjfhloadmphkbplddo)

## ✨ Features

- Create and manage your own quick filters (e.g. by assignee, state, or any search query).
- Apply them with a single click — no need to type search strings every time.
- Edit, duplicate, or remove filters via a clean UI.
- Seamlessly integrated into YouTrack Agile Boards.

This extension brings a long-requested feature (see JetBrains request [JT-38623](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JT-38623)) directly into YouTrack.

## 🙌 Motivation

- Jira has had quick filters for ages ([docs](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/create-quick-filters-for-your-board/)).
- YouTrack users have been requesting the same feature for almost 10 years:
    - [YouTrack support forum thread](https://youtrack-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000751664-Agile-board-Quick-Filters)
    - [Feature request in YouTrack itself](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JT-38623/)

So I decided to just build it myself 🙂
